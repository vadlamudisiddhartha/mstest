I have one solution here. We will be running a scheduler every morning. In it we will got through every page from the root path and get the tag values and find the match with the list of content fragments from the root path. Once the tag matched we will add a new property called cfpath with the content fragment path. We will have content fragment component in the page which will read the content fragment path from the page and language from the page path and display the content accordingly. While next day when the scheduler runs it will check the if page have cfpath and it matches to the current then it will ignore and goes to next page. In this way we can avoid the query type of implementation.
