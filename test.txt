1) Create a Scheduler 
2) Picks only activated pages
3) Edited time should be lesser than activated page
4) Recursive function of pages match with the content fragment 
5) created a map with the matched page and content fragments
6) once map is created we will use that map and get all the data from the content fragment 
7) sort the data and create a map with page and content fragment data
8) add the content fragment data to the page in a property 

Page component:
1) Read the newly added property in the content fragment html and display on the page
2) add the content fragment html to the body.html of the page

Note:
1) For bold not sure how can we achieve it need to check it.
2) We can schedule this scheduler for a day or a week as per our wish
3) In this way it won't hit the disclosures library.
